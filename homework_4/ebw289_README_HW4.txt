How to run my program:

go into the folder where all the files lie named : "homework_4"

in terminal type: "javac Main.java"
	to compile
then type: "java Main"
	to run
This will output a file named : "ouput.txt"

This is what we run our MAP score based on.
*note* Make sure there is not already an output.txt file existing in the folder before compiling and running, because I simply add to the end of the file.
